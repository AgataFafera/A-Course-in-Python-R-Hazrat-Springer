## Exercises:
### 1.1 Compute:
$\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}} + \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}+\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{3^2}+\frac{1}{4^2}}}$

### 1.2 Compute:
$(\frac{1}{2}+ \frac{1}{3}+ \frac{1}{5}+ \frac{1}{7} )+(\frac{5}{2}+ \frac{5}{3}+ \frac{5}{5}+ \frac{5}{7})+(\frac{11}{2}+ \frac{11}{3}+ \frac{11}{5}+ \frac{11}{7})$

### 1.3 Show that for any two positive numbers $a$ and $b$, if $a+b=1$, then
$(a+\frac{1}{a})^2 +(b+\frac{1}{b}^2)\geq\frac{25}{2}$

### 1.4 Use Python to show that (use the library math or numpy)
$\tan\frac{3\pi}{11}+4\sin\frac{2\pi}{11}=\sqrt{11}$

### 1.5 Show that
$\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{64}(2^2+(1/2)^2)-1}=4$

### 1.9 Using Python, demonstrate that 
$\frac{1+\sin(x)-\cos(x)}{1+\sin(x)+\cos(x)}=\tan(x/2)$

### 2.1 Define a list of the form:
z=[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4] , [x5, y5]]

Use Python’s list methods to construct the following lists from z:

• [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]

• [y1, y2, y3, y4, y5]

• [[y1, x1], [y2, x2], [y3, x3], [y4, x4] , [y5, x5]]

• [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, x5, y5]

• [[x4, y4], [x2, y2]]

• [[x1, y1], [x3, y3], [x5, y5]]

### 3.1 Find the number of positive integers: 
$0 < 𝑛 < 20000$ such that 1997 divides $𝑛^2 + (𝑛 + 1)^2$. Try the same code for 2009 and 2022.

### 3.3 For integers:
$2 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 200$, find all $𝑛$ such that $𝑛$ divides $(𝑛 − 1)! + 1$. Show that there are 46 such $n$.

### 3.4 Show that:
There is only one positive integer $𝑛$ smaller than 100 such that $𝑛! + (𝑛 + 1)!$ is the square of an integer.

### 3.9 Consider the number 485. 
Observe that 485 + 584 = 1069 is a prime number. Find all numbers $𝑛$ between 1 and 1000 such that $𝑛$ plus its reverse is prime.

### 3.15 Compute:
$\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}}+\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}}+...+\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{2022^2}+\frac{1}{2023^2}}$

### 4.2 Write a function
Write a function which returns an answer of True if the $𝑛$’th prime number is of the form $4𝑘 + 1$ for some integer $𝑘$. Hence produce a list of those positive
integers $𝑛$ lying between 1 and 100 such that the $𝑛$’th prime is of such a form $4𝑘 + 1$. Verify that there are 47 such $n$.

### 4.4 Write a function to calculate the following:
$p(n) = 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1}+\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{4}} + ... \frac{1}{\sqrt{n-1}+\sqrt{n}} $

### 4.9 For a number $𝑛$, a proper divisor $𝑘$ is a number which is not $𝑛$ and which divides $𝑛$. 
For example, {1, 3, 5} are all the proper divisors of 15. Consider the sum of all the proper divisors of a number. Now consider the sum of all the proper
divisors of this new number and repeat the process. If one eventually obtains the number which one started with, then this number is called a social number.
Write a program to show that 1264460 is a social number. Check whether 14316 is also a social number.

### 4.11 We call a pair of prime numbers $𝑝$ and $𝑞$ friends 
if $𝑝𝑞$ and $𝑞𝑝$ are both prime (by $𝑝𝑞$ we mean the juxtaposition of the numbers together). For example, the prime
numbers 563 and 587 are friends as 563587 and 587563 are both primes. Write a program to produce all the prime friends for some suitable range of primes.

### 4.12 The number 𝜋 starts with
3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679 · · ·
and continues with no pattern. Search the first 100, 000 digits of $𝜋$ and check if your birthday appears as a sequence of digits in $𝜋$. For example the date Thursday 8th of April of 1971 appears in the digits of $𝜋$:
